This hacker cat has had a variety of experiences, starting in DFIR, transitioning to CyberFX/Deception, going deep into Ontology, and ending up in IAM (current role).
However, here are some highlights that relate to what you can find on GitHub:
- [D3FEND](https://github.com/d3fend) team member (Apr 2021 - Oct 2021) and still working on [issues](https://github.com/d3fend/d3fend-ontology/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20author%3Avikhari%20) and [PRs](https://github.com/d3fend/d3fend-ontology/pulls/vikhari)
- Stood up & ran [CASE](https://github.com/casework) and its Adoption Committee (Sep 2017 - Oct 2020), including creating its [first utility](https://github.com/casework/CASE-Utility-Verifier) for verifying/exporting data
- Part of other not-as-public efforts, such as an Android acquisition and analysis tool ([PMF](https://www.mitre.org/our-impact/intellectual-property/periodic-mobile-forensics)) and a cyber deception [ATT&CK Evaluation](https://evals.mitre.org/)
- Interested in automating things but thinks a balance needs to be struck between defaults and customization (see my [DEFAULTS](https://github.com/vikhari/DEFAULTS))
- Performed research in approximate matching (A.K.A. similarity hashing): [M.S. thesis](https://github.com/vikhari/Sim-Find)
- Passionate about thinking better (reasoning via [human](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason#Deductive_reasoning), [machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasoning_system), and between the two) - "You can never think too much, you can only ever think badly" - [Alain de Botton](https://youtu.be/-EvvPZFdjyk?si=CoZTHdn8kGyM0Qjq&t=701)
